/**
 * BoxTest is a glassbox test of the Box class.
 *
 * Recall that like a BallContainer, the Box is a container for Balls and you
 * can only put a Ball into a Box once. After you put the Ball into the Box,
 * further attempts to do so will fail, since the Ball is already in the Box!
 * Similarly, you cannot expect to remove a Ball from a Box if it is not inside
 * the Box.
 *
 * In addition, a Box differs from a ballcontainer because it only has a finite
 * volume. As Balls get put into a Box, it gets filled up. Once a Box is full,
 * further attempts to put Balls into the Box will also fail.
 *
 * @see ps0.Ball
 * @see ps0.BallContainer
